Complete Web Development Bootcamp (Programming Hero – Batch 13)
This repository showcases my learning journey as a junior 
web developer through the Programming Hero Complete Web 
Development Bootcamp (Batch 13). It includes module-wise 
practice code, assignments, and projects that reflect my 
hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), 
React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, authentication, and Git/
GitHub. Through this work, I am developing strong 
fundamentals, improving my problem-solving skills, and 
learning to write clean, maintainable code while building 
real-world applications. This repository serves both as a 
learning record and as part of my GitHub portfolio for 
internship and junior developer opportunities.
